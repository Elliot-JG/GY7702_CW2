# GY7702 Assignment 

## :wave: Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This is a repository for the [**GY7702 R for Data Science**](https://le.ac.uk/modules/2020/gy7702) assignment at the University of Leicester. 
The aim of this assignment was to explore data analysis and multiple linear regression models  
 

This assignment is broken down into 2 stages: 

1. Data exploration 
2. Development of a multiple linear regression model

The dependencies for the assignment are:
* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
* [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/)
* [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/)
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
* [gridExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/gridExtra.pdf)
* [kableExtra](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/)

Note, some of these (dplyr and ggplot2 for example) are included within the tidyverse. However, in the spirit of transparency I thought I would list them all
