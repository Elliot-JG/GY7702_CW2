# GY7702 Assignment 

## :wave: Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This is a repository for the [**GY7702 R for Data Science**](https://le.ac.uk/modules/2020/gy7702) assignment at the University of Leicester. 
The aim of this assignment was to explore data analysis and multiple linear regression models. I learnt how to carry out extensive exploratory data analysis in R and assess the effectiveness of a multiple linear regression model   
 

This assignment is broken down into 2 stages: 

1. Data exploration 
2. Development of a multiple linear regression model
