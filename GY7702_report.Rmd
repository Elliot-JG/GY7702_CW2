This document was created to meet the requirements of GY7702 R for Data 
Science at University of Leicester. It was designed and created in R Markdown, a 
markup language that allows users to create documents that can be formatted to embed code blocks, code outputs and hyperlinks.
When the R Markdown file is compiled, the markup language is hidden and the document is displayed in plain text.

This content was created using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/), [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)


The libraries used in this assignment were 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(pastecs)
library(knitr)
```
